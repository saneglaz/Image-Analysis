This set of scripts is designed to automatically calculate density maps from the supraquiasmatic nucleus. Animals were injected intraviteally with cholera toxin subunit B fused to different alexa fluorophores (CTB-Alx488 & CTB-Alx647))
The analysis of this visual nucleus is complicated by the bilateral pattern of visual projections. 
A transgenic mouse line driving recombination (TdTomato+) in ipsilateral retinal ganglion cells was employed. 
In this way, we can differentiate real ipsilateral projections and bilateral projections from the contralateral RGC population.
CTB-Alx/TdTomato positive pixels will be selected.  

The ImageJ macro work with OIB stacks, generated by Olympus devices.

The sum of the two sides of the nucleus was considered as the total signal. 
In addition, both retinal input (Alx488 and Alx647) were averaged and signal intensity was normalized prior to grouping the samples.

The process consists of 2 steps:

0- The user must create two file before starting:
   - flip.txt: The macro consider the left side as the contralateral for CTX-Alx488, so it will be called green side. The same happens for CTX-Alx647.The flip file includes a logic vector with "YES" or "NO" depending if an horizontal flip is needed.
   - angles.txt: This file contain necessary rotation in degrees to place the nucleus perfectly alineated. 

1- RUN "1_Density_map_SCN.ijm" macro in Fiji (ImageJ) on each sample folder to obtain a binary mask of the secondary channel
   - Two ROI (region of interest) files are provided. One for each side.
   - The macro will ask the user to move each ROI to the correct place

2- RUN "2_Density_map_SCN.R" script in R. 
   - Density map from the right side should be flipped horizontally in order to be visualized in the proper orientation (see "Density_map.tif" as an example of the resulting maps)
   (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/saneglaz/Image-Analysis/master/Density/Density_map.tif)
   - Additionally, the script will calculate the ratio of projections projecting to the contralateral and the ipsilateral side (see "Ratio Cross_No-cross.tif" file as example)
